# Introduction to AI and Machine Learning

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are changing the world, making it easier for computers to do things that only humans could do before. With new AI tools that can create content based on simple instructions, there are now more ways than ever to use this technology in everyday work and life.

For example, if you’re a developer, you might want to add AI features to your app to make it more useful. If you work with data, you could build an ML model to help solve problems at your job. Even if you’re just curious about AI, learning about it can spark fresh ideas for new projects or businesses.

This hand book is here to help you understand how AI works and show you how to start using it. You’ll learn about basic tools that can help you get from raw data to useful AI solutions. We’ll also explore how you can use generative AI tools to develop your own projects.

#### What is this book about?

This book is a practical toolbox, filled with essential AI technologies and tools that you can use to build new projects or enhance your existing ones. We’ve organized these tools in layers, so you’ll start with the basics, like data storage and analytics, and work up to advanced topics like building custom ML models. Along the way, you’ll explore generative AI solutions that can generate content, solve problems.

#### Objectives

By the end of this book, you will be able to:

- **Understand** the basics of AI and how it can be applied to real-world projects.
- **Recognize** the essential tools needed to turn data into AI-driven solutions.
- **Identify** different options for incorporating AI into various types of projects.
- **Start experimenting** with AI, giving you the confidence to innovate and explore new possibilities.

### Why AI and How It Can Help Businesses?

These might be your first questions. Let's explore an example to understand how AI can make business operations more efficient.

**City Wheels**, a local company that provides bike rentals in cities like Amsterdam, Chicago, and Sydney, is a good example.

City Wheels faced three main challenges:

1. **Choosing Locations and Optimizing Routes**: Predicting the best spots for bike rental stations and optimizing bike routes based on weather and traffic.
2. **Demand Prediction and Real-Time Tracking**: Predicting rental demand and tracking performance in real-time to ensure enough bikes are available.
3. **Automating Customer Alerts**: Automating notifications to customers about station availability or weather conditions to help them plan their ride.

Recognizing the potential of AI, City Wheels sought help from **Bright Analytics**, a data consultancy, to use data and AI to solve these challenges.

### A Simple Dashboard for City Wheels

The team created a simple dashboard to show the performance across the cities they operate in, providing insights into metrics like **revenue**, **bike availability**, and **rental duration**. They used common tools like **spreadsheets** for data logging and scripts for analyzing data.

For example, the dashboard shows statistics about Amsterdam, such as rental frequency, average revenue per bike, and station performance. In the top left corner, you can see the **weather conditions**, which helps the system suggest route changes based on forecasts. For example, if rain is expected, it might suggest safer, covered routes.

### AI-Powered Predictions and Alerts

City Wheels used prediction tools to forecast peak rental times. If a major city event like a festival was happening, the system would automatically adjust bike availability to meet increased demand.

The AI also helps with **customer alerts**. For example, if a station is running low on bikes, a script automatically sends messages to customers about nearby available locations. This feature makes sure customers always have up-to-date information, improving their experience.

### Streamlined Business with AI

Adding these basic AI features helped City Wheels achieve the following benefits:

- **Better Operations**: Improved the efficiency of bike distribution across stations and ensured enough bikes were available using real-time data.
- **Improved Customer Experience**: Automated notifications and route suggestions helped customers have a more informed and convenient rental experience.
- **Easier Scaling**: With automated dashboards and scripts, City Wheels could expand operations without adding much administrative work.

Behind the scenes, the approach was simple:

1. **Data Collection**: Collecting data on bike rentals, station performance, and customer preferences using simple spreadsheets.
2. **Prediction and Automation**: Using scripts for demand prediction and customer alerts.
3. **Visualization**: Showing the insights through an easy-to-use dashboard.

By using these tools, City Wheels made their operations more efficient, improved customer service, and increased productivity—showing how even basic AI and data-driven methods can lead to big improvements in business performance.
